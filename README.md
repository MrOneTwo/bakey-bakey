Credits:
- xNormal python wrapper by [orangeduck](https://github.com/orangeduck/Python-xNormal) (I did expand it with one option)

Baking maps with python and xNormal. Started from a _transfer\_maps.py_ script which allows easy rebaking to the same mesh with different UVs (with proper normal map rebaking).
