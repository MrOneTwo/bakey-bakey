# bakey-bakey

Credits:
- xNormal python wrapper by [orangeduck](https://github.com/orangeduck/Python-xNormal) (I did expand it with one option)

Baking maps with python and xNormal. Started from a _transfer\_maps.py_ script which allows easy rebaking to the same mesh with different UVs (with proper normal map rebaking).


## Usage

Just run the script with python with folders for high and low meshes.

```bash
python bakey-bakey.py high low
```

## In consideration

- At this point you can't add cages folder so only distance baking is supported.
